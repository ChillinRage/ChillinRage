## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science undergraduate at National University of Singapore, specializing in Software Engineering, Networking and Distributed Systems.
I occasionally contribute to open-source projects such as NUSMods, and I also work on personal projects for my own interest.

I'm currently learning web development frameworks such as ReactJS to build websites, and Java for school work. Python has been my go-to language for LeetCode, as well as for
small pet projects.


Random Project: HoloCure Fishing Bot (to be updated later).
